      <description>Post-Extract Processing Recently, I have experienced many crashes and slowdowns when using Cellebrite Reader. This is more than likely due to some of the enormous sizes of UFDR reports that I am generating. Every time that a UFDR report is opened, Cellebrite Reader has to load the UFDR report and process it. Cellebrite PA (Physical Analyzer) does perform some file compression when packing it into a UFDR report. Although, this greatly outweighs the recoupment of space as there is a large amount of data that has to be packed regardless.</description>

      <description>Acquiring an Encrypted Virtual Machine Disk Image Example Case:&#xA;The exhibit in this instance had ORACLE VirtualBox installed and was actively using a Windows 7 VM (Virtual Machine) to acquire and download illicit material. The VM had a single encrypted disk that was encrypted through VirtualBox&amp;rsquo;s Full Disk Encryption. A password was provided for the encrypted disk. There is possibility to decrypt the Disk Image through Hashcat if required.&#xA;MAGNET AXIOM supports importing VM disk images, although only in a decrypted state.</description>
